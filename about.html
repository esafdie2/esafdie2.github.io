<h1>Edmond Safdie</h1>

<h2>Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil</h2>

<p>
My name is Edmond Safdie, and I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. When I was 15 years old I moved to Israel and lived there for a semester. After that, I came back to São Paulo and started pursuing my interests.

In high school, I took IB economics classes which sparked my curiosity about it. I also participated in an investment competition, representing my school, organized by Wharton and reached the global finals.

In college, I enjoy studying finance and economics, which I plan to double major in. This year, I was invited to represent Babson College in an economics competition organized by the Federal Reserve where I continue to follow my interest in economics. This summer, I interned at an investment fund in Brazil in which I gained experience in investing.

I like watching TV shows, reading, playing sports and spending time with my friends/family during my free time. My favorite books are One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Phillip Fisher and The Outsiders by William Thorndike. I like playing soccer and tennis.

If you wish to talk to me about any of the interests listed above or anything else, please feel free to contact me!
