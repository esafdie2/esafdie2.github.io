    <meta name="description" content="My name is Edmond Safdie, and I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. When I was 15 years old I moved to Israel and lived there for a semester. After that, I came back to São Paulo and started pursuing my interests. In high school, I took IB economics classes which sparked my curiosity about it. I also participated in an investment competition, representing my school, organized by Wharton and reached the global finals. In college, I enjoy studying finance and economics, which I plan to double major in. This year, I was invited to represent Babson College in an economics competition organized by the Federal Reserve where I continue to follow my interest in economics. This summer, I interned at an investment fund in Brazil in which I gained experience in investing. I like watching TV shows, reading, playing sports and spending time with my friends/family during my free time.">
